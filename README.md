# SERVERLESS-FUNCTION-EXECUTION-PLATFORM
Built a serverless platform similar to AWS Lambda that supports deploying and executing Python and JavaScript functions via HTTP requests. The platform enforces execution constraints such as time limits and resource usage. It leverages optimized virtualization technologies including Firecracker MicroVMs, Nanos unikernels, and Docker containers for efficient function isolation and scalability.

Features a real-time web dashboard to monitor execution metrics such as latency, error rates, and resource utilization, providing users with actionable insights into function performance.
